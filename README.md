# [Joe Blog](https://flowofcode.com)

This is the source code to my blog. I built this blog as a project using
[Go](https://go.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/). Go is a language I enjoy
using. HTMX is an interesting technology, more so because of the concept
behind it, Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS).
